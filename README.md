# XrmToolbox Plugin Rolereplicator
Xrmtoolbox has made Dynamics CRM developer life easy.
I have created a plugin for Xrmtoolbox user.
With the help of this plugin:-
1. You can check user's Security roles.
2. You can check user's Teams.
3. You can check user's  Queue.
4. This tool allow you to copy one users Security roles and team Queues to list of selected users.

Note: Selected users and copy from user should be of same business unit.
